# Unique-NY-Challenge-1

## Description:

This project represents an example of an on-the-job ticket where I am given a starter-code and asked to modify and refactor it to follow accessibility standards so that the sample website (Horiseon Digital Marketing website) is optimized for search engines like Google and Bing.
In addition, I was tasked with improving the codebase for long-term stability by ensuring all the links are functioning correctly, increasing the efficiency of the CSS file by consolidating the selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
I used HTML and CSS in this process to practice the new skills with these technologies that I have been developing in this first week of UNCC's Full-Stack coding bootcamp.

## Usage:

This project can be used to demonstrate adding accessibility alt tags to images for better Search Engine Optimization as well as an example for improving a codebase by ensuring all the links are functioning properly, increasing the efficiency of a CSS file by consolidating the selectors and properties to follow semantic structure of HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
